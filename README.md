# Image-Classification-Samples
This repository is for learning how to classify images with machine learning algorithms with tensorflow + keras using some of the sample image datasets embedded within tensorflow.

## Fashion-MNIST
* Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images. 
This is a very popular and simple dataset that works well as a starting point for understanding machine learning. Images of the dataset as well as a more sophisticated explanation of the algorithm and dataset are available [here](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)
